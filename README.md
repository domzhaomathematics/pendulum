# pendulum
Simulation of many types of 1D and 2D pendulums, springs and different systems built with them (Coupled pendulums, Coupled springs, pendulum+spring,etc) using 3 different numerical analysis algorithms(RK, Euler-Cromer, Newmark) and implementing 23 classes with different inheritence scheme following the good practices of object oriented programming. There is also the graphical component of the project to show the simulation in real-time using QT 3.0.1. To do so , we needed to create the graphical shapes (for the masses) and define the movements in a 3D space.

In this repo, there are all the files necessary to run the simulation. First of all, in the tests folder, there are all the .cc and .h files implementation of the classes. In the exercice_p10 folder, there are all the graphical components of the project.We also take advantage of the c++ language and extensively use pointers and templates. All the MakeFiles are provided. 

To run the the text simulation , you need to run the exercicep9.cc file in /exercice_P10/text/.
To run the graphical simulation, after downloading QT 3.0.1 , you need to run 

The project is done in french, so all the conception diagram,documentation, journal, code is in french.
